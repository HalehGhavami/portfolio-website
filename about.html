        <h1 id="mystory">About me</h1>
        <p>
          I'm Haleh a <span>&lt; web developer &gt; </span>with a background in
          CAD design.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my Full-Stack Web Development Program, I’ve acquired the
          following technical skills: <br />&#11088; The ability to create
          websites and applications with <span>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</span>.
          <br />&#11088; Advanced frontend techniques like
          <span>React</span> and <span>Angular</span>. <br />&#11088; The
          knowledge to create <span>APIs with Node.js</span> <br />&#11088; The
          ability to work with different
          <span>databases and storage solutions.</span> <br />&#11088; The
          mastery of a lot of common practices regarding
          <span>security, ethics, testing, and documentation</span> for my
          development projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the non-technical skills I’ll need to collaborate effectively,
          I have mastered: <br />&#11088; Everything from
          <span>communication and empathy</span> to being approachable and
          showing <span>respect towards diverse experiences and skills.</span>
          <br />&#11088; Being <span>detail-oriented</span> by nature (I studied
          Cellular and Molecular Biology). <br />&#11088; Being an aesthete
          person. I love and appreciate works of art and beautiful things which
          means I have a <span>good eye for design.</span> <br />&#11088;
          <span>Patience and accountability</span>. I often taught colleagues
          modeling with different 3d design programs from scratch.
          <br />&#11088; <span>Customer-centricity</span> is one of the most
          important accomplishments from my previous career because most of my
          projects were remotely and in direct contact with end-users, I have
          had the experience of final customer satisfaction with patience and a
          sense of responsibility. <br />&#11088; One of the skills that I pride
          myself on is that I don't put limits on <span>learning</span>, which
          led me to change my career field and enter the world of web
          developers, which is constantly evolving. <br />&#11088; I don't
          believe in problems but I am known as a good
          <span>problem-solver</span>. I have heard many times that a web
          developer is actually a problem-solver, but in my opinion, the word
          "problem" has a negative connotation and the first thing I do is use
          the words "lock" and "key" instead of using the words "problem" and
          "solve". It is one of some methods I use. I will try to find or make
          the &#128273; to that &#128274;.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span
            >I welcome opportunities to demonstrate my skills in a web developer
            role at a team whose diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts are a
            major part of their culture would allow me to create meaningful
            value for our customers and their end-users.</span
